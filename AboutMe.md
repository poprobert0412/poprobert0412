Junior QA Tester | ISTQB-Certified | Based in Brașov, Romania  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am a highly motivated Junior QA Tester with a strong passion for software quality, continuous learning, and effective teamwork. Currently, I own and manage a ride-sharing business on Uber and Bolt, where I oversee operations, coordinate drivers, manage finances, and ensure customer satisfaction. This experience has honed my skills in coordination, problem-solving, and decision-making, all directly transferable to QA.

In 2024, I completed a comprehensive Python Programming and QA course with The IT Factory Group, focusing on manual and automated testing using Python, Selenium, and BDD frameworks. Shortly afterward, I earned the ISTQB Foundation Level certification, deepening my knowledge of structured testing processes and industry best practices.

I am now eager to transition full-time into the QA field, leveraging my technical skills and leadership experience within a collaborative and innovative team. I have a particular interest in test automation and am committed to continuously improving both products and processes.
