- 👋 Hi, I’m Pop Robert.
- 👀 I’m interested in Python programming, QA automation, music, gaming, and cars.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python development and honing my skills in QA automation.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Python projects, QA automation testing, or anything related to music, gaming, or cars.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/him.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm passionate about gaming and cars. Hiking through nature is a favorite pastime of mine, but when I'm home, you'll find me diving into games. And there's nothing like jamming out to my favorite tunes while coding, embracing the beauty of life in every moment.
