Junior QA Tester | ISTQB-Certified | Owner & Fleet Manager in Ride-Sharing (Uber & Bolt) | Based in Brașov, Romania  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I’m a highly motivated Junior QA Tester with a strong passion for software quality, continuous learning, and teamwork. Currently, I run my own ride-sharing business as **Owner and Fleet Manager** on **Uber and Bolt**, where I manage operations, drivers, finances, and customer satisfaction. This experience has strengthened my skills in coordination, problem-solving, and decision-making—skills that translate perfectly into QA work.

In 2024, I completed a QA course with *The IT Factory Group*, where I focused on both **manual and automation testing**, using tools like **Python**, **Selenium**, and **BDD frameworks**. Shortly after, I earned my **ISTQB Foundation Level certification**, further reinforcing my understanding of structured testing processes and industry best practices.

Now, I’m looking to transition full-time into the **QA field**, where I can apply my technical knowledge and leadership background in a collaborative, forward-thinking team. I’m particularly interested in test automation and always seeking ways to improve both products and processes.
